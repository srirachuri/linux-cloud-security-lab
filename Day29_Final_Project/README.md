# 🌟 Day 29 — Final Project  
AWS EC2 Linux Server Administration & Support Lab
Project Overview
This project demonstrates deploying and administering an Ubuntu Linux server on AWS EC2 using the AWS Free Tier.

The goal of this lab was to gain practical experience with Linux system administration, remote server access, system services, logs, permissions, package management, web server configuration, and basic troubleshooting.

This project was completed as hands-on preparation for Linux Support, Technical Support, Cloud Support, and Junior Linux Administration roles.

Environment
Cloud Platform: AWS
Service: Amazon EC2
Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Instance Type: AWS EC2
Architecture: x86_64
Remote Access: SSH
Web Server: Nginx
Package Manager: APT
Service Manager: systemd
Shell: Bash
Objectives
The main objectives of this project were to:

Deploy a Linux server using AWS EC2
Connect to the server securely using SSH
Perform basic Linux system administration
Manage files, directories, users, permissions, and ownership
Install and manage software packages
Monitor system services
Work with Linux system and authentication logs
Install and configure Nginx
Verify and troubleshoot Linux services
Practice basic Linux support and troubleshooting workflows
Tasks Performed
1. AWS EC2 Linux Server Deployment
Created an Ubuntu Linux EC2 instance using AWS.

The instance was configured for hands-on Linux administration and cloud infrastructure practice.

2. SSH Remote Access
Connected to the Ubuntu EC2 instance remotely from Windows PowerShell using SSH.

Example:

ssh -i "linux-key.pem" ubuntu@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>
This provided hands-on experience with:

SSH
SSH key authentication
Remote Linux administration
Linux command-line access
Security Note: Private SSH keys and sensitive AWS credentials were never uploaded to GitHub.

3. Linux System Administration
Performed basic Linux administration tasks including:

whoami
pwd
ls -l
mkdir
These commands were used to verify the current user, working directory, files, directories, and permissions.

4. File Permissions and Ownership
Practised Linux permission management using:

chmod
chown
ls -ld
Example workflow:

mkdir test_app
chmod 777 test_app
ls -ld test_app

chmod 755 test_app
sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu test_app
ls -ld test_app
This demonstrated practical understanding of:

Linux permissions
Read/write/execute permissions
File ownership
User and group ownership
5. Package Management
Updated the Ubuntu package repositories using:

sudo apt update
Installed Nginx using:

sudo apt install nginx -y
This provided hands-on experience with the Ubuntu APT package management system.

6. Nginx Web Server Installation
Installed and configured the Nginx web server on the EC2 Ubuntu instance.

Verified the service using:

sudo systemctl status nginx
The service was successfully shown as:

Active: active (running)
This demonstrated experience with:

Software installation
Nginx
systemd
Service status verification
Linux web-server administration
7. Linux Service Management
Used systemd to inspect running services:

systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
This provided practical experience identifying active Linux services such as:

nginx
ssh
cron
systemd-journald
systemd-networkd
systemd-resolved
unattended-upgrades
8. Linux Log Analysis
Inspected system logs using:

sudo journalctl -xe
Also examined authentication logs:

sudo cat /var/log/auth.log
Used log information to understand:

SSH connections
User sessions
Authentication activity
sudo activity
System services
System startup/shutdown events
This is particularly relevant to Linux Support and Technical Support roles.

Troubleshooting Skills Practised
During the project, I practised the basic troubleshooting workflow used when investigating Linux server problems:

Identify the problem
        ↓
Check system/service status
        ↓
Review logs
        ↓
Check configuration
        ↓
Apply corrective action
        ↓
Verify the result
Examples of tools and commands used:

systemctl
journalctl
cat
grep
ls -l
chmod
chown
apt
ssh

What I Learned
Through this project, I gained practical experience administering a Linux server running in a cloud environment.

The project helped me understand how Linux administration and cloud infrastructure work together and gave me hands-on practice with the types of tasks commonly encountered in entry-level Linux and cloud support environments.

Career Relevance
This project was created to build practical skills for entry-level roles such as:

Linux Support Trainee
Linux Support Intern
Junior Linux Support Engineer
Linux Technical Support Engineer
Linux Operations Trainee
Junior System Administrator
Cloud Support Associate
It also provides a foundation for progressing toward Cloud Support and Cloud Security roles.
